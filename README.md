Thesis project for the MSc in Data Science and Economics titled "Socio-economic determinants of mental health over time: evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study".

This repository is organized as follows:
- The folder "stata" contains the do file created to create the dataset and perform the main analyses, along with the plots and tables included in the project;
- The folder "python" contains the Jupyter notebooks used to produce plots for the average GHQ-score;
- The two pds files contain the final text of the thesis and the slides used to present the project.
